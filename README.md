# PeriodicTableProject

This is a project I created on code.org originally to help myself and other students in a highschool level chemistry class. 

It includes a database of all the periodic table elements, which can be searched by the element's full name or abrreviation.

Then, information is deisplayed about the element, such as its atomic number, charge, weight, and more
